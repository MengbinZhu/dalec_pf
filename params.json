The particular flavour of particle filter that's being used is the sequential Metropolis-Hastings filter, described in [Dowd (2007)](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~mdisney/teaching/teachingNEW/methods/diff/Dowd.Bayesian_DA.JMSys.2007.pdf). You can fidn the Python code files, but also an IPython notebook with a lab on exploring this DA frameweork. An HTML-rendered version of the IPython notebook is available [here](DA_practical.html), or you can see it in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jgomezdans/dalec_pf/blob/master/DA_practical.ipynb).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using on UCL's UNIX system\r\n\r\nNote that in order to use the notebook, we need to do the following:\r\n    \r\n    source activate ipy3\r\n    \r\nThis lets you use the IPython notebook version 3.0.0. To have access to the notebooks etc, you can change the directory to your data storage (typically ``~/DATA``), and\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/jgomezdans/dalec_pf.git\r\n    \r\nIf you're running this on a computer without ``git``, you can just download [the zipfile](https://github.com/jgomezdans/dalec_pf/archive/master.zip). Note that the only dependencies here are\r\n\r\n* IPython notebook (>= v 3.0.0)\r\n* Matplotlib\r\n* Numpy\r\n* Scipy\r\n\r\nThese are all available from e.g. [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) standard distributions.","google":"UA-25702318-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
