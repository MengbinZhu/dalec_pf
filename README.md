# Experiments with the DALEC ecosystem model and a sequential Metropolis particle filter

## J GÃ³mez-Dans (NCEO & UCL)

This repository contains Python code to carry out some computational experiments with an
ecosystem model (the [DALEC](http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/mwilliam/DALEC.html) of Mat Williams in Edinburgh) using a particle filter. The particular flavour of particle filter that's being used is the sequential Metropolis-Hastings filter, described in [Dowd (2007)](http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~mdisney/teaching/teachingNEW/methods/diff/Dowd.Bayesian_DA.JMSys.2007.pdf). You can fidn the Python code files, but also an IPython notebook with a lab on exploring this DA frameweork. An HTML-rendered version of the IPython notebook is available [here](DA_practical.html), or you can see it in [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jgomezdans/dalec_pf/blob/master/DA_practical.ipynb).
